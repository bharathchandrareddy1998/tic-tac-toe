# tic-tac-toe
Tic Tac Toe is a classic 3x3 grid game for two players, implemented in Java. Players alternate marking 'X' or 'O', aiming to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first to achieve this wins; if the grid fills without a winner, it's a draw. 

## Game Description

The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking empty cells with either an 'X' or an 'O'. The objective is to get three symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to achieve this wins the game. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
